# Creational (5):
Factory Pattern
When to use:
Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. 
Adv: 
1, Factory design pattern provides approach to code for interface rather than implementation.
2, Factory pattern removes the instantiation of actual implementation classes from client code. Factory pattern makes our code more robust, less coupled and easy to extend. 
3, Factory pattern provides abstraction between implementation and client classes through inheritance

DisAdvantes:
A potential disadvantage of Factory methods is that clients might have to sub-class the creator class just to create a particular concrete product object.
In Factory Method pattern, the factory used for creating the objects is bound with the client code, i.e., it is difficult to use a different factory for creating objects.
 Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/929021/what-are-static-factory-methods

 There are two version of factory.
 1, static factory method: To control the number of objects to create.
 2, factory method: A method which separates the instantiation of class from client program.

Implementation: https://github.com/Sathish-509/DesignPatterns-Examples/tree/master/src/factorypattern

Builder: Builder provides you more control over the object creation process. we can achieve immutability.
UserBuilder which helps us in building desired User object with all mandatory attributes and combination of optional attributes, without loosing the immutability.

Advantages:
Design flexibility and much more readable code.
The parameters to the constructor are reduced and are provided in highly readable method calls.
Builder pattern also helps minimizing the number of parameters in constructor and thus there is no need to pass in null for optional parameters to the constructor.
Another advantage is that Object is always instantiated in a complete state rather than sitting in an incomplete state until the developer calls 

Disadvantages:
Though Builder pattern reduce some line of code buy eliminating the need of setter methods, still in double up total lines by introducing the Builder object. 
# Structural (7):
# Behavioral (11):
Strategy:
Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.

Strategy pattern is also known as Policy Pattern.
Ex: Collections.sort() method that takes the Comparator parameter
Adv:
Families of related algorithms. Hierarchies of Strategy classes define a family of algorithms or behaviors for contexts to reuse. Inheritance can help factor out common functionality of the algorithms.

Inheritance offers another way to support a variety of algorithms or behaviors. You can subclass a Context class directly to give it different behaviors.

A choice of implementations. Strategies can provide different implementations of the same behavior.

Disadv:
Clients must be aware of different Strategies. The pattern has a potential drawback in that a client must understand how Strategies differ before it can select the appropriate one.
Communication overhead between Strategy and Context. The Strategy interface is shared by all ConcreteStrategy classes whether the algorithms they implement are trivial or complex.
Increased number of objects. Strategies increase the number of objects in an application. Sometimes you can reduce this overhead by implementing strategies as stateless objects that contexts can share.

ChainofResponsibility:
Used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them

Advantages:
1. Decouples the sender of the request and its receivers.
2. Simplifies your object as it doesnâ€™t have to know about the chain structure and keep direct references to its members.
3. Allows you to add or remove responsibilities dynamically by changing the members or order of the chain.

Disadvantage:
1. Hard to observe the run-time characteristics and debug.
